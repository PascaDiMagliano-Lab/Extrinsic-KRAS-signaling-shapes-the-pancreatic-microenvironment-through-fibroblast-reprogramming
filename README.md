# Extrinsic-KRAS-signaling-shapes-the-pancreatic-microenvironment-through-fibroblast-reprogramming
This repository includes the code used for data processing and visualization of single cell RNA sequencing data as presented in the manuscript **“Extrinsic KRAS signaling shapes the pancreatic microenvironment through fibroblast reprogramming”**. Running this R script as uploaded will generate Figures 3G-H, 4A-E, 5C, and S4A-B found in the manuscript. Raw data files are available through the NIH Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), accession numbers [GSM4175981](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM4175981) (iKras* 3 weeks ON) and [GSM5435110](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM5435110) (iKras* 3 weeks ON + 3 days OFF).
